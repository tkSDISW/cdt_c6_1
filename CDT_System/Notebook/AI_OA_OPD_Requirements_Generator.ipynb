    "# Operational Process to Requirements CSV Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook facilitates the transformation of a list of operational processes into a structured input file and subsequently executes a program to generate a CSV file containing system requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Operational Processes**  \n",
    "   - The user provides a list of operational processes in a structured format (e.g., YAML or JSON).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Generate a Structured Input File**  \n",
    "   - The notebook processes the input and generates a structured file suitable for requirement extraction.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Execute AI based requirement Extraction**  \n",
    "   - The structured file is used as input for a processing script that generates a CSV file of requirements.\n",
    "   - Extract and format a CSV file `{file_name}` of responsibile entity, requirement heading, a requirement body in the form of \"The \"entity name\"  shall \"entity action\" and \"action measurable ot obsererable\".\n",
    "   - 1. The first row should contain headers: 'responsible entity',`requirement heading' ,'requirement body `.\n",
    "     2. Each row should contain the responsible entity, requirement heading and its requirement body.\n",
    "     3. Ensure the output is enclosed within triple backticks (` ```csv `).\n",
    "     4. Sorted by responsible entity.\n",
    "     5. Return only the formatted CSV content.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Output CSV File**  \n",
    "   - The extracted requirements are stored in a CSV format for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
