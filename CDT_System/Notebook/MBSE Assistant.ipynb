    "### Purpose\n",
    "This cell launches an interactive chat session based on the structured input file, leveraging ARCADIA and Polarion terminology to ensure the analysis remains consistent with the modeling context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "- Uses the generated structured input file (e.g., `capella_model.yaml`) to guide the conversation.\n",
    "- Supports ARCADIA terms such as **functions**, **components**, **activities**, and **exchanges**.\n",
    "- Incorporates Polarion terms like **workitem**, **requirement**, and **traceability** for seamless integration with requirements management workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "1. The structured input file provides context for the chat session.\n",
    "2. You can interactively query details about the model elements, relationships, and dependencies.\n",
    "3. Responses are tailored using ARCADIA and Polarion terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Prompts\n",
    "- **For ARCADIA:**\n",
    "  ```plaintext\n",
    "  What are the dependencies and exchanges for the selected function in the Logical Architecture phase?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For Polarion:**\n",
    "  ```plaintext\n",
    "  Provide the traceability matrix for the workitem linked to this component.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "### 🛠️ Instructions\n",
    "1. Ensure the `capella_model.yaml` file has been generated and is up-to-date.\n",
    "2. Run this cell to start the interactive chat session.\n",
    "3. Enter your queries using **ARCADIA** or **Polarion** terms for accurate and relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 Notes\n",
    "- The interactive chat dynamically adapts to the content in the structured input file.\n",
    "- Use precise and contextual queries to ensure the best results and insights.\n",
    "\n",

       "1. **Impact Detection:**\n",
       "   - *Failure Mode:* The system may fail to detect impacts.\n",
       "   - *Effect and Cause:* This can lead to undetected concussions, perhaps due to sensor failure or misplacement.\n",

       "   - *Effect and Cause:* This limits post-impact evaluations due to potential memory issues.\n",

       "3. **Alert System:**\n",

       "4. **Data Security:**\n",
